# Grab for Jaspr

The [Jaspr][jaspr] version of Grab.

Grab is a package providing mixins and extension methods to trigger a rebuild
on change in a `Listenable` (`ChangeNotifier`, `ValueNotifier`, etc).

This works the same way as the original [Grab][grab] for Flutter. Please see
its documents for details.
